  pages={1237-1244},
  abstract={This paper presents a comprehensive SPICE model of a power inductor including winding losses, eddy current losses within a soft magnetic ferrite material and hysteresis losses as well as the self-resonance. With an adaption of the well-known Steinmetz's equation for hysteresis losses, non-sinusoidal waveforms of hard-switching topologies such as DC/DC converters or PFC stages are taken into account. The small-signal impedance of the power inductor is modeled on basis of small-signal measurements that are adapted to an equivalent circuit by an algorithm. Outstanding advantages of the model are the simple generation out of data sheet parameters and a single impedance measurement as well as a good accuracy.},

In this paper, the implementations and the applications of Ampere’s Law are determined, studied and analyzed based on the journals that are related to Ampere’s Law. Initially, eight related journals are picked and chosen as our references and subsequently, one journal out of these that we understand the most and most complete and informative will be our main reference and we basically prepare and write this paper based on this main reference by comparing the main reference with the rest of the journals in terms of the performance, methods, results, discussions and so on. As a result, we understand that the Ampere’s Law can be implemented and applied in many ways and applications in order to solveproblems.}

  abstract = {DC microgrids have become a prevalent topic in research in part due to the expected superior efficiency of DC/DC converters compared to their AC/DC counterparts. Although numerous side-by-side analyses have quantified the efficiency benefits of DC power distribution, these studies all modeled converter loss based on product data that varied in component quality and operating voltage. To establish a fair efficiency comparison, this work derives a formulaic loss model of a DC/DC and an AC/DC PFC boost converter. These converters are modeled with identical components and an equivalent input and output voltage. Simulated designs with real components show AC/DC boost converters between 100 W to 500 W having up to 2.5 times more loss than DC/DC boost converters. Although boost converters represent a fraction of electronics in buildings, these loss models can eventually work toward establishing a comprehensive model-based full-building analysis.},

  abstract = {A new methodology to calculate the hysteresis induced power loss of inductor from the measured waveforms of DC-to-DC converter during the voltage conversion is presented. From this study, we find that the duty cycles (D) of the buck and boost converters used till date for inductance current calculation are not exactly equal to VOUT/VIN and 1-VIN/VOUT as the inductance change induced by the hysteresis effect cannot be neglected. Although the increase in the loading currents of the converter increases the remanence magnetization of inductor at the turn-off time (toff), this remanence magnetization is destroyed by the turbulence induced vortex current at the transistor turn-on transient. So, the core power loss of inductor increases with the loading current of the converter and becomes much larger than other power losses and cannot be neglected for the power efficiency calculation during power stage design.},
